# Preface

Welcome to **The Node.js and React Beginner Book**. The aim of this book is to teach you everything you need to know to build full-blown web applications that are useful, reliable, and fast, using modern JavaScript features and tools.

We will start with the basics and build on these step-by-step. Everything is explained in detail and taught at just the right pace, making sure that everything sticks and can be understood easily.

All you need to bring to the table is a basic understanding of programming in general. That is, you should already know what a variable is, how an `if` statement works, what a `string` and an `integer` are, and how to run commands on the Command Line Interface of your computer.


# Setting up your software development environment

In order to be able to create JavaScript applications with Node.js and React, you need to have a set of programs and tools installed on your computer, which together make up the Software Development Environment that allows you to work efficiently and build great stuff.

This environment consists of the following components:

- A powerful code editor, also called Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
- The Node.js interpreter and its supporting tools, used to run your application code and to manage additional code libraries used by your own code
- A command line interpreter, also called a terminal, which you will use to run important commands on
- A web browser, in order to use and test the web applications which you will build


## The browser and the terminal

It's more than likely that you already have a terminal and a web browser on your system. It doesn't matter if you use Firefox, Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Safari, or Opera. Personally, I prefer Firefox, but every modern web browser will do.

If you are working on a Windows system, your command line interface or terminal is `cmd.exe`. Simply type `cmd` with the Start menu open, and hit enter. This will open a terminal window.

On macOS, the terminal application is simply called "Terminal". Simply launch it from folder "Utilities", which resides in folder "Applications". Alternatively, you can hit CMD+Space to bring up Spotlight Search, and enter "Terminal" in order to launch it.

Linux systems come in so many different forms and shapes that I can only assume you know how to open a terminal window. On Ubuntu systems, it is simply a matter of clicking the Ubuntu icon in the upper left corner of the screen and typing "Terminal" into the search form.


## The code editor

There a many different code editors / IDEs available that enable you to write Node.js and React JavaScript code. Which one fits best for you really is a matter of taste.

Personally, I use *IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate Edition* from JetBrains, but this is just one possible option.

A very good IDE that runs on all three platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux), is available for free, has great JavaScript, Node.js, and React support, and is very well-liked in the JavaScript developer community is *Visual Studio Code* from Microsoft, often simply called *Code*. Visit https://code.visualstudio.com/ to download it for your platform.

Simply follow the installation instructions, and you are good to go. In the course of this book we will also install some extensions for Node.js and React, but for now the base install does the job.


## Node.js

Last but not least, we need to install Node.js itself. While a code editor is all that is needed to write JavaScript code, we would not be able to do anything useful with that code. In order to turn our code into a running Node.js application, we need the so-called Node.js interpreter. This is a program which reads our JavaScript source code, interprets its meaning, and executes it.
