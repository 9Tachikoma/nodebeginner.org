# Preface

Welcome to **The Node.js and React Beginner Book**. The aim of this book is to teach you everything you need to know to build full-blown web applications that are useful, reliable and fast, using modern JavaScript features and tools.

We will start with the basics and build on these step-by-step. Everything is explained in detail and teached at just the right pace, making sure that everything sticks and can be understood easily.

All you need to bring to the table is a basic understanding of programming in general. That is, you should already know what a variable is, how an `if` statement works, what a `string` and an `integer` are, and how to run commands on the Command Line Interface of your computer.


# Setting up your software development environment

In order to be able to create JavaScript applications, you need to have a set of programs and tools installed on your computer, which together make up the Software Development Environment that allows you to work efficiently and build great stuff.

This environment consists of the following components:

- A powerful code editor, also called the Integrated Development Environment
- The Node.js interpreter and its supporting tools, used to run your application code and to manage additional code libraries used by your own code
- A command line interpreter, also called a shell, which you will use to run important commands on
- A web browser, in order to use and test the web applications which you will build
